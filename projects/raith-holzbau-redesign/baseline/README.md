# Phase 0: Baseline Screenshots

"Before" screenshots of the site, captured before any modernization. Use these later to compare against the redesigned version.

## Captured screenshots

| Page | Filename | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| Home | `baseline-home.png` | Live site |
| Über uns (content page) | `baseline-ueber-uns.png` | Live site |
| Galerie | `baseline-galerie.png` | Live site |
| Kontakt | `baseline-kontakt.png` | Live site |
| Impressum (legal) | `baseline-impressum.png` | Live site |

**Source URL:** https://www.igust.de/projects/raith-holzbau-redesign/

## How to re-capture (if needed)

1. **Option A — Live site:** Open https://www.igust.de/projects/raith-holzbau-redesign/ and subpages, take full-page screenshots.

2. **Option B — Local:** Start the site with `npx serve .` or `python -m http.server 8000`, then open the equivalent URLs on localhost.

3. **Optional:** Capture a mobile view (e.g. 375px width) of the home page as `baseline-home-mobile.png`.

## Notes

- Screenshots were taken at default desktop width (~1200–1400px).
- These files are for internal reference during the redesign and can be added to `.gitignore` if preferred.
