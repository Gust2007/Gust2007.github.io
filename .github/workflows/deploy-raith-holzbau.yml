# Builds the Raith Holzbau Astro site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
#
# IMPORTANT – one-time setup required in the repository:
#   Settings → Pages → Source → select "GitHub Actions"
#   (instead of the default "Deploy from a branch")
#
# After that, every push to master that touches files in
# projects/raith-holzbau-redesign/ will trigger a fresh build and deploy.
